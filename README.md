I made a HOMM3 Random Faction selector - it has an animation (like you're rolling a dice, I'm working on making a dice people can print to use physically)
It has an option to choose mulligan so you can reroll your choice
It will cross out the faction on the left as soon as it is rolled
It can be reset to roll again if needed
If you have ideas or wishes for further options, let me know!
